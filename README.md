I'm a domain architect, mentor, and cloud advocate with over 20 years professional experience. I specialise in desinging and building enterprise applications and solutions, principally in the Azure Cloud. I love a challenge and I'm skilled at progressing from a simple proposal into a well-defined and deliverable solution.

I live and work in Melbourne, Australia, but over my careeer I have lived and work in Singapore, Japan and USA (North Carolina).
